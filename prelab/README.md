# Lab 1 Pre-lab

This folder is for uploading your schematics
and completing your [Digital](https://github.com/hneemann/Digital) simulations
as part  of the pre-lab.

When complete, submit to Gradescope.

You will use other files in this same repository (but above this folder) for the lab itself!

See [Lab 1 Pre-lab](https://usafa-ece.github.io/ece281-book/lab/lab1.html#pre-lab) for detailed instructions.
